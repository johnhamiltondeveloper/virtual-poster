# Development Environment

tools local

- nodejs (v14.16.0)

For local development you can use mySQL workbench as a sql server - https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench - (v8.0.22)

The SQL schema can be found in `./virtual-poster/MySQL/database_schema.sql` this is the SQL code that can be used to setup the mysql schema

**importent** The mysql database system will have to be in **legacy authentication mode**

how to change mysql workbench to legacy authentication mode

- executing the mysql install file
- select "Reconfigure" over the mysql server
- In Authentication Method tab, select "Use Legacy Authentication Method"

With in backend folder you need to change the given value below found in the `.env` file to ones used by your mysql database. 

- `DB_HOST=` will need to be the ip of your database
- `DB_USER=` will need to be the user you have setup in the database to be the access user
- `DB_PASS=` this will be the user password that is used for the mysql user account
- `DB_DATABASE=` will need to be set to the database you are accessing with in the mysql system

```
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=password
DB_DATABASE=database
```
